#Tech Event Review

##Johnny Mayer

###What was the name of the tech event? What date did it occur?

I attended a Thinkful sponsored event, "Build a Twitter Bot with JavaScript".  It was held on Tuesday, February 27th, 2018, in the CENTRL West Office at NW 14th and NW Everett in Portland, OR.

###Who/what organization coordinated the event? If there were speakers, who spoke?

[Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com) coordinated and held this event.  Thinkful is a programming school that focuses on a mentorship model.  They have locations across the United States.

[Danielle Heberling](https://danielleheberling.xyz/) was the main speaker/leader of the event.  She shared a bit of her personal story, which I found to be inspiring.  As a self confessed band geek in high school, she opted to enter college to pursue music education.  After a few years as a music teacher, she decided that she was uncomfortable with the politics of teaching in the public sector.  She knew she did not want to work retail or food service, and decided to get into programming.  She now works full time in the field, as well as being a mentor with Thinkful.

[Will Chertoff](http://www.willchertoff.com/) from [Ask a Dev](https://askadev.org/) Portland was also present at the meetup, and gave a short quip about Ask a Dev Portland and their related events.

###What was the format of the event?
The event was formatted much like a round table discussion.  Danielle coordinated a step by step process via slides, and attendees were encouraged to assist each other and provide tips.  It was similar to Epicodus in this way, that a group mentality oftentimes combines skills of many minds to complete tasks.

###What was the topic or main focus of the event?
The event's focus was building an automated bot for Twitter in JavaScript.  It was a great introduction to node.js and the Twitter API via Twit from npm.

###What made you want to attend this particular event?
I got really excited about this event after reading about it.  Twitter is an often overlooked platform for communication, social interaction, and a wide variety of other uses.  There is nothing much like Twitter anywhere else on the internet.  Due to this fascination, I thought to myself, "How can I engage Twitter on a different level than I am used to?  What can I offer Twitter and its users in terms of interaction and content?  How can I interface with Twitter in a way perhaps no other users have?"  I am fascinated with bots overall.  I think that there are near infinite possibilites for what can be automated, for an equally infinite number of reasons as to why a function could be automated.  I was also excited at the opportunity to engage with other people in the field outside of existing contacts, to meet and see what others are doing, and take a chance at some networking.

###What was the highlight of the event?
For me, the highlight of the event was the final product.  I feel like I got a great introduction to Twitter's API and a bit of experience playing with it.  The event also gave me the chance to satisfy a curiosity of how Twitter bots and social media bots work in general.

###What did you learn from this experience?
I learned that Twitter is not fond of bots at all.  The limits Twitter sets on pull requests, posts, and almost any type of data interaction are constructed in such a way that it makes bots easily detectable and even more easily blacklisted.  I also learned that there are definitely ways to circumvent these timeouts and blacklistings, through using JS setTimeouts and setInterval, as to limit the pull requests and posts a bot makes to aid in the prevention of blacklisting.  I also learned that Twitter's API is incredibly vast, and that there is quite a lot to learn as far as its included methods, usability, and deployment.

###If you could give feedback to the coordinators of the event, what would it be?
I really like how the event was structured.  Thinkful definitely has great coordinators and teams working to host these type of events.  Their experience and expertise was truly shown at this event.  After much thought, I cannot say that I have any constructive criticism to offer regarding the event, its structure, or its content.

###Would you recommend the event (or a similar event) to your peers?
I would definitely recommend this event to anyone interested in JavaScript, Twitter bots, Twitter's API, or even Thinkful itself.  I look forward to attending more of their events in the future.

###Additonal Notes
[TwitterBotV1](https://github.com/johnnymayer/TwitterBotV1) is available via my GitHub.  I plan to use the framework and source code to further expand my knowledge of bot construction and how to deploy the Twitter API more effectively.
